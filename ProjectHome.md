Team: Greg Lieberman, Richard Rapp, Anthony Ghavami

We intend to build a variation of Cube Runner for the iPhone:

In the game, the player is constantly moving forward, and must move left or right to dodge cubes.

So this involves:
- iPhone OpenGL ES
- 3D
- Perspective Projection
- Point - Bounding Cube Collision Detection
- Drawing Polygon Primitives
- We may also want to add touch events for fireworks and other particle effects.

As far as our tasks go:
- Greg: iPhone SDK Pro. will focus on accelerometer, touch screen events, framework setup. Some OpenGL.
- Anthony: OpenGL drawing routines. Drawing and moving shape primitives.
- Richard: OpenGL drawing routines. Particle effects.
